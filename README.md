# 8_puzzle
This project is my first homework from the course Artificial Intelligence in school.

This is an Artificial Intelligence for the 8-puzzle problem.
This system can be separated to four part.
They are:
1. Solvability.py
2. Successor.py
3. Manhattan_distance.py
4. Priority_queue.py
- I made this system step by step as above.
- Test data from : http://cjlin.nlplab.tw/AI1102_assignments.html#prj1_5
- The coding detail and used principle are in the module such as above.

# Outline
+ This AI only can solve 8-puzzle problem(3*3 Dimension)
+ Each puzzle tile only can be distinguished by its number on itself.
+ The number 0 represent the empty tile in the puzzle.
+ This AI uses the A* algorithm to search best solution.
+ This AI's heuristics function use the Manhattan distance to calculate.
